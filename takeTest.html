    Discrimination has no true logical point in existing in the human race. It's only results are pointing out the differences between people and seperating us even more. If people actually took the time to look at each other and think, they would realize that we are not that much different. What we should be focusing on is creating a better world for the future generation that will harbor this world and teaching them to teach their kids to take care of this earth.
   If you judge the color of your skin then you have no right to judge in the first place. People should be judged by their character.
